# Cricket Match Score Keeper
Android application that helps log cricket match scores. The app does not currently support decrementing runs or wickets. This may be added in a future version. However, you will not lose any data when changing orientation of the mobile device. This app has been built to the specifications of the score keeper project rubric that is part of the Udacity's Android Basics: User Input module.

### Objective
The goal is to create an Score Keeper app which gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different teams playing a game of your choice.

### Tools
* Gradle v4.1
* Android Plugin v3.0.1
* Android API v27
* Android Build Tools v27
